# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently the only versions we have are `main` and `development`. They are both obviously supporting security updates:

| main        | :white_check_mark: |
| development | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you see a vulnerability in our Oxese language-learning code, you can send us a security vulnerability at mastxzmessaging@gmail.com. You should also [create an issue](https://github.com/JavascriptLearner815/laughing-oxe/issues/new?assignees=JavascriptLearner815&labels=bug%2C+good+first+issue%2C+help+wanted%2C+security+threat&template=security-vulnerability.md&title=%5BTHREAT%5D+).

The guaranteed date when your security vulnerability will be updated is on the first of every month.

As soon as we are aware of a possible security threat, we will create a public advisory at https://github.com/JavascriptLearner815/laughing-oxe/security/advisories.

If your vulnerability is accepted, we will create a public advisory if we haven't already.

If it is declined, we will still create a public suspected advisory with your name attached. We will also add the "invalid" tag if you created an issue.

If your vulnerability got declined, you can follow up with another reply with more information. Use any sources you can find about the vulnerability.

If we change our mind, we will change our advisory to have complete confidence in our information.

If we still don't change our mind, we will add the "wontfix" tag to your issue until we change our mind.
